# Conda

This document serves as a quick reference guide for using Conda, a package and environment management system. Conda is commonly used for managing Python packages, but it can also manage packages from other languages. It allows you to create isolated environments with different package versions and dependencies.

## Installation

To install Conda, follow the instructions for your operating system from the official Conda documentation:

- [Conda Installation Documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

## Environment Management

- **Create a new environment:**

  ```shell
  conda create --name myenv
  ```

  For specifying a specific Python version:

  ```shell
  conda create --name myenv python=3.8
  ```

- **Activate an environment:**

  ```shell
  conda activate myenv
  ```

- **Deactivate the current environment:**

  ```shell
  conda deactivate
  ```

- **List all environments:**

  ```shell
  conda env list
  ```

- **Remove an environment:**

  ```shell
  conda env remove --name myenv
  ```

- **Create a requirements.txt file:**

  ```shell
  conda list --explicit > requirements.txt
  ```

- **Create an environment from a requirements.txt file:**

  ```shell
  conda create --name myenv --file requirements.txt
  ```

- **Export an environment to a YAML file:**

  ```shell
  conda env export --name myenv > environment.yml
  ```

    > The resulting YAML file can be used to recreate the environment.

## Package Management

- **List installed packages:**

  ```shell
  conda list
  ```

- **Install a package:**

  ```shell
  conda install packagename
  ```

  For specifying a specific version:

  ```shell
  conda install packagename=1.2.3
  ```

- **Update a package:**

  ```shell
  conda update packagename
  ```

- **Remove a package:**

  ```shell
  conda remove packagename
  ```

- **Search for a package:**

  ```shell
  conda search packagename
  ```

## Managing Channels

Conda uses channels to find and install packages. Here are some commands for managing channels:

- **Add a channel:**

  ```shell
  conda config --add channels channelname
  ```

- **Remove a channel:**

  ```shell
  conda config --remove channels channelname
  ```

- **List configured channels:**

  ```shell
  conda config --get channels
  ```

## Miscellaneous Commands

Here are a few more commands that can be handy:

- **Update Conda itself:**

  ```shell
  conda update conda
  ```
