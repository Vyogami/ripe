<h1>Ripe</h1>
</p>

Welcome to Ripe, a digital garden that houses a vast collection of my notes, self-documentation, and intellectual musings. This digital realm encompasses a variety of subjects, ranging from development tools and programming languages to occasional flashes of genius that strike me during midnight snack breaks!

Ripe is built using Docusaurus, a feature-rich documentation generator. With Docusaurus, you can easily create beautiful and interactive documentation websites like this one. To learn more about Docusaurus and how to use it, refer to the official documentation
