Welcome to Vyogami, a digital garden that houses a vast collection of my notes, self-documentation, and intellectual musings. `Vyogami` is derived from the Sanskrit word `Vyomagami,` meaning "something that passes in the sky," this digital realm encompasses a variety of subjects, ranging from development tools and programming languages to occasional flashes of genius that strike me during midnight snack breaks! üçïüöÄ

But brace yourself, my intrepid readers, for the contents within are not for the faint of heart. They possess blending potent incantations with unforeseen bugs, and even the cryptic annotations of long-lost CodeReaper from bygone eras.
